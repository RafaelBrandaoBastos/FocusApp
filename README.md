# Flux: Focus and Productivity

## Overview

As the name implies, Flux's main goal is to be a simple productivity app, helping its users keep track of their routines and goals in the long run, all while offering some functionalities for short-term activity tracking. These include a timer, a stopwatch, and a way of visualizing past activity (e.g. a heatmap calendar).

## Target Audience

The target audience is the user who finds himself having trouble with reaching their goals, mainly because of some sort of impairment in the capability to plan ahead and follow through with their ideas. A good example of people with such impairments are those who have ADHD. Of course, the general public may very well find uses for the app as well, as there is no reaon why they wouldn't be able to extract value from it.

## Releases/Technologies Involved

The app will be developed for _**Android only**_ as far as we (the developers) are concerned. That is because the project is mainly intended as an experiment for academic purposes, that is, to get familiarized with the technologies listed below:

- [Dart Programming Language](https://dart.dev/)
- [Flutter Framework](https://flutter.dev/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/)
